# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date: January 31, 2025**

## Introduction

Thank you for using applications developed by ruiqianyi (hereinafter referred to as "the App"). We take your privacy seriously. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.

## Core Principles

**The App uses a fully localized data storage solution**. All data is stored locally on your device and is never uploaded to any external servers or cloud services.

## Information Collection and Use

### Information We Collect

The App only collects and stores data locally on your device that you actively input or generate during use. The specific data types depend on the app's functional features.

### Data Storage Method

**All data is stored in your device's local storage** (such as SQLite databases, local files, etc.) without any network transmission. This means:

- Your data is completely stored on your device
- We cannot access any of your data
- Data is not shared with any third parties
- There are no network requests or external data transfers
- There is no risk of data leakage through networks

### Purpose of Data Use

The collected information is used solely for the following purposes:

- Providing core app functionality and services
- Saving your personal settings and preferences
- Improving the app user experience
- Enabling data display and management features within the app

## Data Security

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- Data security entirely depends on your device's security settings
- We recommend regularly backing up your device data to prevent data loss
- Uninstalling the app will permanently delete all local data
- We do not provide cloud backup, sync, or recovery services
- We recommend using device security measures such as screen lock passwords to protect your data

## Permissions

The App may require the following device permissions (depending on app functionality):

- **Storage Permission**: To read and write data files locally on your device
- **Other Functional Permissions**: Only used to implement specific app features

We promise:
- Not to request any unnecessary permissions
- All permissions are used solely for core app functionality
- Not to use permissions to collect information unrelated to app functionality

## Third-Party Services

The App **does not integrate any third-party services**, including but not limited to:

- Third-party data analytics services
- Advertising services or ad SDKs
- Social media SDKs
- Cloud storage services
- User behavior tracking services

Your data is not shared or transmitted to any third parties.

## Network Connectivity

The App **does not make any network requests**, including:

- No connections to any remote servers
- No uploading of any user data
- No downloading of any external content (except normal app store updates)
- No data synchronization of any kind

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and discover that your child has used the App without your consent, please contact us.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your data at any time by:

- Deleting specific data records within the app
- Clearing app data (through your device's app management features)
- Uninstalling the app, which will permanently delete all locally stored data

## Data Export

Since data is stored locally, you can:

- Export data through your device's backup features
- Access data files through your device's file management features (if your device allows)
- Export data using the app's export features (if available)

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any significant changes will be communicated through:

- App update notes
- In-app notifications
- Update descriptions in the app store

We recommend reviewing this policy regularly to stay informed.
